# Web Script Editor - A Live HTML, CSS, and JS Editor

## Overview:
The Web Script Editor is a powerful tool that allows users to write HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code and see the results in real-time in their browser. It is designed to provide an interactive coding experience with live reload functionality.
it now includes another file called the interpreter aka bat2html converter which allows you to write html pages using the windoes batch scripting language for those that arent familiar with using html, css, or javascript yet. 
## Features:
1. **Live Editing**: Write HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and see the changes live in your browser. Enjoy real-time updates as you code.
2. **JSFiddle Integration**: Send and export your project directly to JSFiddle for further experimentation and sharing.
3. **Automatic Saving**: Utilize the buttons to save your project automatically as an HTML file for downloading and future reference.
4. **GPT API Interaction**: The latest update replaces the bito AI iframe with a brand new feature that allows the GPT API to interact with and display the HTML code directly on the screen, rendering it automatically upon submission of input.
5. **Output Rendering**: The tool fetches the output and renders it on the page as HTML, similar to how Codex's JavaScript sandbox functioned in OpenAI's original version.
6. **Inspired by OpenAI's Codex**: This tool is based on the JavaScript sandbox by OpenAI Codex. Since OpenAI shut down their version earlier this year, this tool was created as a code editor strictly for HTML, with recent updates adding full-on JavaScript sandbox-like features.

## Ongoing Work:
This project is a work in progress, with continuous updates and enhancements being made to improve its functionality and usability. It represents a dedicated effort to provide a seamless coding experience for web development enthusiasts.

### Enjoy your coding journey with the Web Script Editor!
